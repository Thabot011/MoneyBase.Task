1- Clone the app  <Br/>
2- Choose the [MoneyBase.Web] and [MoneyBase.BackGroundService] as startup projects  <Br/>
3- Run the app then migrations will apply automatically <Br/>
4- You will see page where will you be asked to enter chat title then click start chat <Br/>
5- Chat will be assigned as per ciretieria described in the task  <Br/>
6- To have many active chats we should have application tab per chat that will keep the polling happening  <Br/>
7- We can check chat status in db and also check the assigned agent to it <Br/>

Thanks
